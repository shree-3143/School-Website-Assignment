# School-Website-Assignment

The school assignment was to create a website advertising the (made-up) company “Janko”. 

The purpose of this website is to promote a new product, which is being used to expand Janko’s product line. I decided to sell flowers as my product on my website.

I ended up having 6 different HTML documents – all of which were linked. These included a website homepage, an About page which described the product (flowers) that was being sold, the 2 different pages of products (annual flowers and perennial flowers), a sign-up page, and a page that the user is directed to when they submit their form on the sign-up page.

Additionally, I used 2 different stylesheets for the website, one was a main stylesheet (style.css), and the other (products_style.css) was dedicated solely to the products pages.
